## 🔧 Currently Working On

I'm currently working on several projects:
- #### Inkwell
  This a platform that would provide writers with a portfolio to showcase their skills and works to potential employers, help connect with other writers, and grow their audience through     writing articles with the help of our in-platform AI. => [Inkwell](https://useinkwell.vercel.app/)

- #### Qrdini
  Qrdini is an API built especially for frontend devs, in other to help them generate and store QR codes. Currently Qrdini is in the beta version but work has begun to roll out V1, if you are interested in using Qrdini it's free, so check it out here => [Qrdini](https://jaminco.github.io/Qrdini)
